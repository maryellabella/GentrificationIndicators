This project investigates how property data can signal gentrification across Chicago neighborhoods. Using data from the Cook County Assessor’s Office, we analyzed changes in assessed property values, foreclosures, and parcel sales over five key years (2000, 2006, 2012, 2018, and 2023). These years align with the county's 3-year reassessment cycles. Our goal was to identify early indicators of displacement and neighborhood transformation.

Using data and shapefiles from the Cook County Assessor’s Office and the City of Chicago, we converted parcel-level data into neighborhood averages for spatial analysis. The data was then visualized in a Shiny app featuring interactive charts and maps.

The project culminated in an interactive Shiny Dashboard with three main tabs:
- Assessed Value
- Foreclosures
- Parcel Sales

Each tab features:
- A Top 10 Neighborhoods chart showing the highest differences between selected years.
- An Altair Line Graph to visualize temporal trends within a selected neighborhood.
- A Choropleth Map that highlights neighborhood-level values with interactive tooltips.
